## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This organization is used for personal projects that would greatly benefit from the added functionality and grouping that organizations provide.

The main project that I am working on is a new and improved Kubernetes deployment strategy and microservice architecture. Within my personal cluster, I am running the actions-runner-controller and within an organization has the added benefit of only needing one runner config for the entire organization. Additionally, by housing resources related to this project under this org, it will not only cleanup my personal account a bit, but also better show how these repos are related to each other.
